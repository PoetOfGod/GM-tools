# GM-tools version Alpha2.0b
This application is a work in progress multi-functional tool that can assist Game Masters
What started as a simple scroll generator script with a custom GUI has expanded into a full program to assist with running Tabletop Roleplaying Games.  The code is designed to handle content for 5e, however it may be adapted into a more general form to include other popular roleplaying games as newer versions are released.
Currently Development is mostly being done on the Crafting Rules Application and many of the Databases that will be used by upcoming applications.
