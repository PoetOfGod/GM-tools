# GM-tools version Alpha3.4b
This application is a Work In Progress multi-functional tool that can assist Game Masters.

What started as a simple scroll generator script with a custom GUI has expanded into a full program to assist with running Tabletop Roleplaying Games.  The code is designed to handle content for the 5th edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game, however it may be adapted into a more general form to include other popular roleplaying games as newer versions are released.

Currently Development is mostly being done on the Databases that will be used by the existing modules.
